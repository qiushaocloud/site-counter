#### Front-end easy to use

1. Import qiushaocloud_site_counter.min.js, for example: `<script async src="//githubcdn.qiushaocloud.top/gh/qiushaocloud/site-counter@master/dist/qiushaocloud_site_counter.min.js"></script>`

    <p>Total visits: <span id="qiushaocloud_sitecounter_value_site_pv">n</span></p>
     <p>Total Visitors: <span id="qiushaocloud_sitecounter_value_site_uv">n</span></p>
     <p>Today's visits: <span id="qiushaocloud_sitecounter_value_today_site_pv">n</span></p>
     <p>Today's Visitors: <span id="qiushaocloud_sitecounter_value_today_site_uv">n</span></p>
   
     <p>Total visits to this page: <span id="qiushaocloud_sitecounter_value_site_page_pv">n</span></p>
     <p>Total visitors to this page: <span id="qiushaocloud_sitecounter_value_site_page_uv">n</span></p>
     <p>Today's visits to this page: <span id="qiushaocloud_sitecounter_value_today_site_page_pv">n</span></p>
     <p> Today's visitors to this page: <span id="qiushaocloud_sitecounter_value_today_site_page_uv">n</span></p>
````



#### Front-end advanced features

1. Set the maximum duration of the visitor session, the default is 24h [for example, if you set 1h, then the visitor who visits again within 1h is not a new visitor, and the visitor after 1h is regarded as a new visitor. It should be noted that no matter how long it is set, once it crosses the sky. , then the second visit is a new visitor]
``` javascript
    <script>
        window.localStorage.setItem('qiushaocloud_sitecounter_max_session_duration', 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    </script>

    <script async src="//githubcdn.qiushaocloud.top/gh/qiushaocloud/site-counter@master/dist/qiushaocloud_site_counter.min.js"></script>
````
2. Set the server address requested by the interface. After setting, the request will be based on the address you set. If not set, the default interface is [www.qiushaocloud.top](https://www.qiushaocloud.top) [Note: www.qiushaocloud.top. top builds a service for individuals, it cannot ensure that the interface request is ok, it is recommended that you build the server yourself]
``` javascript
    <script>
        // The setting format is: www.qiushaocloud.top or https://www.qiushaocloud.top:443
        window.localStorage.setItem('qiushaocloud_sitecounter_api_host', 'www.qiushaocloud.top');
        //window.localStorage.setItem('qiushaocloud_sitecounter_api_host', 'https://www.qiushaocloud.top:443');
    </script>

    <script async src="//githubcdn.qiushaocloud.top/gh/qiushaocloud/site-counter@master/dist/qiushaocloud_site_counter.min.js"></script>
````
3. Set the signature secretKey of the interface request. When qiushaocloud_site_counter.min.js is loaded, it will delete window.QIUSHAOCLOUD_SITE_COUNTER_API_SIGN_SECRET_KEY
``` javascript
    <script>
        window.QIUSHAOCLOUD_SITE_COUNTER_API_SIGN_SECRET_KEY = 'Signature key you need to set';
    </script>
    
    <script async src="//githubcdn.qiushaocloud.top/gh/qiushaocloud/site-counter@master/dist/qiushaocloud_site_counter.min.js"></script>
````
4. Set the page ID. When you need to count the PV/UV of the page, but your page is distinguished by the address bar parameters (for example: https://yourAddr/yourPathname?page_id=xxx), you can use it at this time this usage
``` javascript
    <script>
        /**
         * Use window.location.pathname + window.QIUSHAOCLOUD_SITE_COUNTER_PAGE_ID to count this interface
         * For example your address: https://yourAddr/yourPathname?page_id=abc and https://yourAddr/yourPathname?page_id=def represent two different articles
         * You set page_id to window.QIUSHAOCLOUD_SITE_COUNTER_PAGE_ID, eg: window.QIUSHAOCLOUD_SITE_COUNTER_PAGE_ID = `${page_id}`
         * When counting, the two articles of yours will be counted by ${yourPathname}+'adb' and ${yourPathname}+'def' respectively
        **/
        window.QIUSHAOCLOUD_SITE_COUNTER_PAGE_ID = 'The page ID you need to set';
    </script>
    
    <script async src="//githubcdn.qiushaocloud.top/gh/qiushaocloud/site-counter@master/dist/qiushaocloud_site_counter.min.js"></script>
